# AWS cli basics 

In some of my previous articles I used the AWS Command Line Interface(cli) without ever explaining how to set it up. 

Some may say that using the cli is hard, but the syntax and usage of the cli is very strait forward. What *is* hard is knowing which service to use and how the service is supposed to be configured. A perfect example is when [I setup a Cloudfront Distribution](setting-up-cloudfront-distribution.html), the cli command was extremely simple, the json required for setting up the districution was not.


### Requirements

* [An IAM role](create-an-aws-iam-user.html)
* [python3 pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-you-can-run-pip-from-the-command-line)
* [read cli documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* <span style="color:#8C4B20">*WARNING* I use Ubuntu Linux, most of my commands should work on linux/mac. If you're running windows, I'm very sorry to hear that, but I can't help you. 

Give the docs linked above in the requirements a read if you haven't already and you'll be better off.

### Steps I'm going to cover

1. Install awscli (Ubuntu 17.10)
1. Use built in method for configuring credentials and settings
1. Understanding cli profiles
1. Alternate methods of specifying credentials and settings
