I'm terrible at talking about myself so this will likely be very short. 

I had never heard of [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) before a brilliant colleague who is a DBA mentioned it to me. There are definitely different degrees that one can experience imposter syndrome and I definitely do to a point. I never think my best is good enough so I constantly try to make it better, while still thinking it's not as good as others. I constantly feel I am far to slow in completing tasks that anyone competant would have completed in 1/4 the time.

I've been around computers for pretty much as long as I can remember. The first computer I ever broke, errr worked on was a 386 that came home from my moms accounting business. I had no clue what I was doing, but I would take it apart, delete files which would stop Windows 3.1 from working. Re-install Windows, and subsequently not delete random things.

I've never been one to have the latest and greatest hardware as I really don't see the value in it. I'm the same way with new tech I generally don't jump on it right away, I like to let things mature a bit before looking into them.

I love networking, unfortunately where I live there are not a lot of networking jobs, so in came system administration. I was hired on at a company as in house support which quickly turned into working on legacy systems while our sysadmin worked on the new projects. I learned a lot of great things with that company, both things to do and things not to do, I'm very thankful as they gave me my start. I've been doing syadmin, now called devops, work ever since. 

Certifications that I currently hold:

* CCNA Routing & Switching
* AWS Solutions Architect Associate
* AWS SysOps Administrator Associate
